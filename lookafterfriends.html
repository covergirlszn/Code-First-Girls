        Being there for your friend can be essential for a persons recovery. 
        The friendship could mean a lot to a person who is dealing with mental health ilness such as depression. 
        People who experience depression often believe they are worthless and that no one cares about their existence. 
        However, you can change these feelings by being listening to their issues and showing compassion or by just 
        simply being present.
